This is the first practical activity of the tecnocampus OS course 2023-2024. This first laboratory provides a comprehensive exploration of basic Linux commands, the structure of the Linux file system, programming in C, and the use of compilation and 'make' utilities. Key concepts include navigating and manipulating the Linux file system, understanding and utilizing essential Linux commands for file and directory operations and pipelines/background operations, and mastering the C programming language for creating a functional application in several progressive steps. Additionally, the laboratory explains the basics of the compilation process, emphasizing the creation and usage of Makefiles for efficient project management and software development in a Linux environment. This hands-on approach integrates theoretical knowledge with practical skills, essential for the next laboratory sessions of the Operating Systems course.
